# NETFLIX-MOVIE-AND-TV-SHOWS-CLUSTERING
About the Project 

This project is all about recommending a variety of movies and TV shows to viewers, which are
managed by the Netflix company. The platform streams the media online. Subscribers can choose
between monthly plans and yearly plans based on how much they want to watch Netflix
simultaneously.

Problem Statement:

This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected
from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine.
In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has
nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming serviceâ€™s number of movies has decreased by more than
2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to
explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset.

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Understanding what type content is available in different countries
3. Is Netflix increasingly focused on TV rather than movies in recent years?
4. Clustering similar content by matching text-based features.
